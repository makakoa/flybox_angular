<h3>Flybox is currently under development</h3>
<h2>"An attempt to catch email up with the rest of the messaging world."</h2>
<p>Imagine being able to delete that email you just sent with an embarrassing typo. Or simply going back and attaching the file you forgot to attach. How about receiving just one notification instead of 5 for a single email thread. That is the power of Flybox. Flybox is an attempt to catch email up with the rest of the messaging world. What we did was create a messaging application with all the latest messaging functions which could seamlessly integrate with email as well as function within the well established networks of email. The project is still under development but you can check on its status here!</p>
