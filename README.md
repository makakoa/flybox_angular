This the old angular version of flybox. The next iteration is currently under development!

# FLYBOX _reloaded_ (deprecated)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/makakoa/flybox_reloaded.svg?branch=m2_dev)](https://travis-ci.org/makakoa/flybox_reloaded)
##### "Next Generation Emailing"

To Do: 
- Attachment handling
- Search flybox
- Search email
- Variable importing
- Change flybox username/password
- Analytics
- Contacts

Bugs: Things that won't work
- sent link needs a url prefix
- account page cancel edit doesn't work
- importing lots of emails imports twice

Debt: Things that might not work later
- test all front end functions
- email thread not really being handled
- guest box ui

Improvements: Things that could work better
- sent emails don't have threads to them
- box add member function needs user check + guest key
- error catching
